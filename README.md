# grunt-init-mvc
  * Version 0.0.0-alpha-unstable
  * Uses: backbone, backbone.marionette, requirejs, ...
  * Requires grunt-init

## Overview
After going through various websites, tutorials, and books I've discovered that backbone scaffolding varies so widely.  So I've decided to put together what I think is the best approach to making your backbone 'true-mvc' with by using scaffolding with `grunt-init`

## Quick Start

`git clone https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init-mvc.git ~/.grunt-init/mvc`

Then go to your project directory, and punch in `grunt-init mvc`
